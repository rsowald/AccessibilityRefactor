# Accessibility Refactor of Horiseon Marketing Homepage

Starting with a working site from Horiseon Marketing, this project refactored for accessibility and long-term sustainability. The focus was on ensuring use of semantic HTML elements, logical flow of HTML and CSS, and alt tags for optimized site performance.

Web accessibility is important consideration for every business with an online presence. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Litigation may even occur when people with disabilities cannot access a company website. Making a website accessible also provides better positioning in search engines like Google.

Clean, logical code is important for long-term sustainability for any application. Many developers may maintain the code over the lifetime of an application, so minimizing redundancies, ensuring a logical flow, and good comments are incredibily valuable.

To achieve these goals, I first refactored and commented the HTML and CSS files to improve the flow for easier maintenance. Then, I consolidated redundancies in the CSS to, again, make it easier to maintain. I turned to accessiblity by first renaming divs to semantic HTML tags. I also made sure there were alt tags on all of the images for maximum accessibility.
