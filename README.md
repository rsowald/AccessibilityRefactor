# Accessibility Refactor of Horiseon Marketing Homepage

Starting with a working site from Horiseon Marketing, this project will refactor for accessibility and long-term sustainability. The focus will be on ensuring use of semantic HTML elements, logical flow of HTML and CSS, and alt tags for optimized site performance.

Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.

First, I refactored and commented the HTML and CSS files to improve the flow for easier maintenance. Then I consolidated redundancies in the CSS to, again, make it easier to maintain. I also made sure there were alt tags on all of the images for maximum accessibility.
