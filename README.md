# Accessibility Refactor of Horiseon Marketing Homepage

Starting with a working site from Horiseon Marketing, this project will refactor for accessibility and long-term sustainability. The focus will be on ensuring use of semantic HTML elements, logical flow of HTML and CSS, and alt tags for optimized site performance.

Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.

improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. For example, make sure that all links are functioning correctly. Also, rework the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.
